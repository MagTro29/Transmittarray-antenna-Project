# Filtering Transmitarray Antenna (1-bit ME Dipole)

This repository documents my Internetworking Project at the
University of Technology Sydney (UTS), focused on the design
and analysis of a **1-bit filtering transmitarray antenna**
based on **magnetoelectric (ME) dipole elements**.

## Project Overview
The project investigates a filtering transmitarray antenna
operating in the Ku-band (~11.5–12.6 GHz). The design integrates
filtering and radiation within the antenna structure and
achieves **1-bit phase control via physical rotation** of the
ME dipole elements.

## Key Technical Concepts
- Transmitarray antenna (TA) architecture
- Magnetoelectric (ME) dipole elements
- 1-bit phase quantisation and wavefront control
- Integrated filtering and out-of-band suppression
- Physical-layer considerations in wireless systems

## Tools & Methods
- ANSYS HFSS (electromagnetic simulation)
- S-parameter and radiation pattern analysis
- Gain and bandwidth evaluation
- Literature-based comparison and validation

## Outcomes
- Stable 3 dB gain bandwidth (~8–9%)
- Strong out-of-band suppression
- Demonstrated feasibility of FA–FA transmitarray structures
- Clear link between antenna design and system-level performance

## Context
This project was completed as part of the **Bachelor of
Information Technology (Networking & Cybersecurity)** at UTS
and demonstrates advanced technical analysis beyond traditional
routing and switching projects.
